PF Limits in OpenBSD

   This article documents one of several insidious little gotchas I've
   encountered using OpenBSD systems in a core-router/firewall capacity in
   lieu of Cisco 2851 or Juniper j4350 class hardware. Specifically,
   various hard memory limits built into PF, which, when encountered,
   cause PF to stop accepting new connections.

   Incidently, [4]here is the story of how I wound up replacing the
   preponderant quantity of my networking gear with openBSD and saved
   metric-oodles of coinage.

   Anyway, the upshot is that if you use OpenBSD with PF in a production
   environment and you aren't aware of PF's memory limit (especially the
   state-related memory limits), you have a ticking time-bomb on your
   network. Just FYI.

   I'd been playing with OpenBSD for fun, in low-budget side projects, and
   non-prod environments for years before that fateful day that I ran into
   the state-table limit like a brick wall.

   It was shortly after I'd replaced the cisco-based core routing
   infrastructure of our Headquarters building with OpenBSD. It presented
   as a sort of network "glitch". You know, the unexplainable little
   connectivity loss that only affects one user. Probably his cable, or
   wall socket. But then it was two or three users, and then it was a user
   whose connectivity was working fine, except for he couldn't create new
   ssh connections suddenly (wha?). It was gone as quickly as it appeared,
   and never seemed to adhere to any sort of consistent set of symptoms.
   It was quite maddening.

   At some point I noticed that if I was quick enough, I could catch a "no
   route to host" error message from PF on the console of the core
   routers, and that's when I really started looking at them in earnest.

   It turns out, as I've already said, the kernel keeps memory set aside
   for PF to do things like create state tables and state table entries.
   In my case I was hitting the limit on the total number of states PF was
   allowed to track at once. This meant that new connections would fail
   with no route to host until some other state expired and made room for
   the new one. This looked downright wierd troublshooting from the
   outside because protocols like HTTP (which are stateless) would still
   work pretty well, while others like SSH (which requires a constant
   connection) were more likely to have problems.

   You can see the default sizes of these limits using pfctl -sm:
# pfctl -sm
states        hard limit    10000
src-nodes     hard limit    10000
frags         hard limit     5000
tables        hard limit     1000
table-entries hard limit   200000

   These are pretty sane defaults for most people who are running OpenBSD
   routers, which is to say, nerds who have wedged it on to their
   [5]soekris board or the wrt54 they found at the second-hand store, or
   the 8086 they found under the sink in their dad's house.

   If you're running production routers on real hardware you're going to
   want to raise those a bit. And by `bit' I mean like two orders of
   magnitude. Do this with a line in your pf.conf that looks something
   like this:

   set limit { states 1000000, frags 1000000, src-nodes 100000, tables
   1000000, table-entries 1000000 }

   You can check to see if you've ever hit one of these limits with pfctl
   -si, which displayes the values for a whole bunch of couters tracked by
   PF:

   If you have RRDTool installed, you can use this shell script to push
   some of these values into an RRD (or repurpose it to feed collectd or
   gmond or whatever):
#!/usr/local/bin/bash

gawk="/usr/local/bin/gawk"
pfctl="/sbin/pfctl"
rrdtool="/usr/local/bin/rrdtool"
RRDHOME='/home/pcap/rrd'

pfctl_info() {
    local output=$($pfctl -si 2>&1)
    local temp=$(echo "$output" | $gawk '
        BEGIN {BytesIn=0; BytesOut=0; PktsInPass=0; PktsInBlock=0; \
               PktsOutPass=0; PktsOutBlock=0; States=0; StateSearchs=0; \
               StateInserts=0; StateRemovals=0}
        /Bytes In/ { BytesIn = $3 }
        /Bytes Out/ { BytesOut = $3 }
        /Packets In/ { getline;PktsInPass = $2 }
        /Passed/ { getline;PktsInBlock = $2 }
        /Packets Out/ { getline;PktsOutPass = $2 }
        /Passed/ { getline;PktsOutBlock = $2 }
        /current entries/ { States = $3 }
        /searches/ { StateSearchs = $2 }
        /inserts/ { StateInserts = $2 }
        /removals/ { StateRemovals = $2 }
        END {print BytesIn ":" BytesOut ":" PktsInPass ":" \
             PktsInBlock ":" PktsOutPass ":" PktsOutBlock ":" \
             States ":" StateSearchs ":" StateInserts ":" StateRemovals}
        ')
    RETURN_VALUE=$temp
}

### collect the data
pfctl_info

### update the database
$rrdtool update ${RRDHOME}/pf_stats_db.rrd --template BytesIn:BytesOut:PktsInPas
s:PktsInBlock:PktsOutPass:PktsOutBlock:States:StateSearchs:StateInserts:StateRem
ovals N:$RETURN_VALUE

   And then use the following to draw graphs from it:
#!/bin/sh

RRDHOME='/home/pcap/rrd'
cd ${RRDHOME}

   which will yield you a pretty, two-axis graph like the one below which
   should help you avoid limits in the future.
