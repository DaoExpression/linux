Your user have access to 'sudo', therefor you can be root too. 

Tmux uses 'ctrl+a' to change tmux behavior. 

vim is using my own configurations 

NodeJS is installed within this user only. 

If you wish to create a dedicated user to host this application, please install using nvm.org 

We don't want root using to be able to use NodeJS, but only 'www-data' group. 

I think you can add this folders from this user, to a virtual-path in Apache2. 

If you need something, please write a message like this one, and leave it in 'om' user folder. 

cloudflared application is already installed. 

acme.sh application is installed in user folder too. 

you have cloudflare folder with some things that can help. 

Maybe I need to change my domain to cloudflare, before being possible to create a tunnel.
